Conclusion:-
We have noticed that,
Mostly the male employees with salary i.e.,upto 5k and 0-5 years experience
in the research & development departmentare leaving the company.
So by increasing the salary of the employees in research and development department 
we can reduce the attrition rate.
and also the Female employees in Human Resources department with 0-5 years experience and upto 5k salary 
are leaving the company.
So by increasing the salary of women employees in Human Resources Department we can reduce female attrition.
